Develop emotion classification models with NLP based approach
1. Project Title: "Classifying Emotion in Text-Based Content"
Author: Hicran Arnold
2. Project Description: Creating nlp approach machine learning model to predict sentiment on the social media data
3. How to Install and Run the Project: This project require pyspark installation. The project has three steps. First clean the data, second use cleaned data and select the best model and the last one is the tune hyper-parameters of the clean . For cleaning and feature selection has been completed in the dataPrep folder in the dataPrep.py.The code cleans and saves  data models to data folder. In the main folder we need to run dataModel.py to get the best model and in finalModelTunning file we tune hyper-parameter of our final data model. 
4. Code Inspiration : [trajanov- Big data analytics ](https://github.com/trajanov/BigDataAnalytics)
5. Road Map: Next I will include neural network, tensorflow library implementation and compare the existing result and lastly I am planning to use the machine learning model to predict a real world data like customer feedback and rates. 
6. List of files:
- Data Folder : saved data
- dataPrep Folder : Inculudes data preparation python file for cleaning and feature selection
- dataModel file : This python file to select the best model
- finalModelTunning file : Review and hyper-tunning the final model
- projectProposal file :  Proposed research 
- projectreport: final report
